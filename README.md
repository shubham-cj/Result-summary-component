## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working with this project I've used CSS Grid to done the work and also `@media ()` for responsive behavior.

```css
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    max-width: 600px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}
```
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {}
```

### Continued development

As I mentioned that I've used CSS Grid to do the work which very useful, because while working with projects that I have done before, I've used Bootstrap Grid to do the work and CSS Grid isso much easier and more flexible than Bootstrap Grid so I'll use CSS Grid in my upcoming projects.

### Useful resources

- [Build Layouts with CSS Grid](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hk02lFb6EkdXF2DYGl4Gg4&si=fsDSRQe2O_6D09oV) - This youtube playlist helped me to build websit using CSS Grid. I really liked the sessions and will use it going forward.
